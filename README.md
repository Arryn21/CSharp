### Learning CSharp from Scratch

## Learnings of Day1

Object Oriented Language
Developed in 2000

As we use import in python, we use "using" keyword in CSharp
eg.  using System;
Remember semicolons are important in this too.

from System we get
Console.WriteLine("");

If we are not using System
we can write
System.Console.WriteLine("");
if we dont want our output in a newline we can write
Console.Write("");
